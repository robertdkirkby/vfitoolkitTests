This is a collection codes that tests the core VFI Toolkit features for FHorz.
It tests with/without d,z,e,semiz
It tests that with/without DC (divide and conquer) gives same answer [and that this is true with/without GI]
It tests that with/without GI (grid interpolation layer) you get same model stats
It tests that lowmemory=1,2 (where appropriate) still give same answer (as lowmemory=0, which is default)
There are also a bunch of 'cross-tests' that aim to test that if you 'disguise an iid as a markov' then you get the same answer as just using an iid. (and analagously 'disgusing a markov as semiz').

All the tests are passed.
